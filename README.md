Thhis is a project to classify pet images (CAT & DOG)

This is a weekend project to dive deeper with a CNN. This model averages out two small CNN models 35MB each, to yeild and accuracy of about 95% 

This model can reach more accuracy by upping epochs and decreasing dropout in PETCNN model and also increasing picture rotation in the data transforms. 

Probably 96-97% Accuracy.
